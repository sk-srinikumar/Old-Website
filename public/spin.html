                        <p>
                            A spin coater is a machine that spins thick fluids so fast that they flatten to a 
                            height of only dozens of microns high! I designed a spin coater for flattening SU-8 
                            25 epoxy through numerous stages of spinning.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>
                            Decent spin coater machines can cost a few grand. Because of budget cuts stemming 
                            from the executive branch of the U.S. government, funds became tight. This allowed 
                            me to design and build a spin coater for less than 100 bucks. So I got to designing 
                            a spin coater that&#8217;s not only cheap but also built for my research purposes. 
                            The wood-shop professor on campus agreed to build me the chassis for free. The doctor 
                            I work under already had soldering equipment. It wasn&#8217;t difficult at all to keep 
                            the costs low.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>
                            Once I designed the machine, I ordered $50 worth of parts including a DC motor, a 
                            power ]supply, and an H-Bridge. I planned to get all the core parts hooked up and 
                            running. Then I could order a custom PCB based on my amateur circuitry job. Finally, 
                            I&#8217;d put together the electronics, chassis and finishing touches. Well... that 
                            &#8217;t happen.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>
                            Right after the parts arrived, my supervisor ended up buying a expensive spin 
                            coater for my research. My enthusiasm for my research, the faculty&#8217;s increasing 
                            interest in my project and the value of time convinced my supervisor that it was worth 
                            the money to purchase a spin coater. Anyways, hit me up if you wanna buy some cheap 
                            parts.

                        <h2>Design</h2>

                        <p>
                            Spin coaters on the market all have two things in common: those awful buttons and displays. 
                            Who wants to be pressing gummy buttons all day? It may look clean but it limits functionality. 
                            Various processes end being programmed through a limited window of buttons. Adding to the 
                            headache are cheap displays that never show the whole picture.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I prefer separate dials for each adjustable setting. It&#8217;s a lot of dials but dials are dirt 
                            cheap. I would love to have a separate display for each setting too, but displays are not dirt 
                            cheap. Since each adjustable setting has such a huge range of options, I thought it would make more 
                            sense to not add number labels around the dials. They&#8217;re cramped, imprecise and difficult 
                            for me to add. Instead, one display at the top of the machine would show every change for every 
                            setting.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You may think that&#8217;s a bad idea. How would someone know what they set each dial to if 
                            there&#8217;s only one display? Isn&#8217;t that inconvenient? Not in this case. My research 
                            includes analyzing spin processes. Meaning I&#8217;ll have every single setting recorded and updated 
                            on paper in front of me at all times. If somebody moves a dial by accident and nobody was aware, 
                            it may end up being extra work for me.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I restricted all interactive items to the sloped area. Sloped areas are ideal because the angle lets 
                            you see all the labels.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the sea of dials, there is a lone button on the bottom right. I thought it was pointless to give 
                            it a label. If a user is looking for the machine&#8217;s start button, they&#8217;ll know which one 
                            it is. Cause it&#8217;s the only button there.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I never figured out where to put the power button. I thought it was something I could figure out later. 
                            At first, I wanted it in the sloped area because it&#8217;s an interactive object. 
                            But the power button is also an indicator like the display.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The dials are <q>chronologically</q> ordered from left to right. Each column of dials falls 
                            under the proper label for specific phases. I won&#8217;t benefit from this ordering. 
                            But if someone were to continue my research or produce microfluidic chips using my process, 
                            the organizing of the dials would help the user understand the process much faster. Also, 
                            it just feels right.
                        </p>

                    <div class="column"><img class="image" src="images/spin/colored.png" alt="Colored View"></div>

                    <div class="column">
                        <p>
                            Painting each column would emphasize the order. If I made the chassis of aluminum and 
                            glass, different intensities of frosting on glass instead of paint would mark the 
                            columns. Maybe it would be different intensities of metal brushing. If I had money, 
                            this machine would end up in a museum of Braun products.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I initially planned on painting the entire chassis, but I realized it would be better 
                            to leave most of the wood unpainted. In a lab with many chemicals, you need to know 
                            what everything is made of so accidents can be dealt with properly.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Some issues are unpreventable. Some epoxy splashes everywhere when you spin at 3000 RPM; 
                            there&#8217;s no avoiding it! The spinning area incorporates a CD cake box lid for 
                            covering. A CD cake box lid is secured into the 3 curved rectangular mechanisms in 
                            the spinning area. Once epoxy build-up cakes the lid, we can throw the lid away and 
                            replace it with another dirt cheap CD cake box lid. It&#8217;s much cheaper to buy a 
                            new lid instead of cleaning the epoxy off the old one.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The part of chassis containing the spinning area is circular. Why is it circular 
                            and not square like the other side? Because... this is the spinning area!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The circular part of the chassis does not slope while the area next to it does. 
                            This will lead weird hand formations when adjusting the dial at the top-right corner. 
                            It&#8217;s fine because that specific setting hooked up to the dial rarely needs any change.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I originally wanted to place the spinning area to the north of the display, but that led to 
                            an undesirable shape and weight distribution. This final long rectangular design is easier 
                            to store and use in the lab I work in.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are 3 LED lights sunk into the sides of the spinning area. These will light up while spinning 
                            is in progress. 3000 RPM is really fast. It&#8217;s fast enough to shoot thin glass through your 
                            eyeball and into your brain. The epoxy is spun and flattened on a glass plate which is secured to 
                            the spinning metal disc only by double-sided scotch tape. The cakebox will usually stop any flying 
                            glass, but you should still be aware of the potential.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It&#8217;s important to keep the spinning stable to produce the desired product and to reduce 
                            accidents. The legs at the bottom of the machine aren&#8217;t just legs. They&#8217;re rubber 
                            stabilizers that handle vibrations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Overall, I&#8217;m proud of this design. The height comes out to about 3 inches; the length 
                            comes out to about 15 inches and the width comes out to about 6 inches. The dials, button, 
                            display, etc. are all scaled after parts I planned on purchasing. Let me know if you use this 
                            design to build your spin coater!
